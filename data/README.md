# E-commerce Customer Behavior Dataset README

This file provides a brief description of the dataset used in the Consumer Behavior in the Post-Pandemic Era project. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and comprises transactional and demographic data from an e-commerce platform. It captures various aspects of consumer behavior, including spending patterns, purchase frequency, and satisfaction levels, along with customer demographics such as age, gender, and city.
