# Visualizations

This folder contains all the figures and charts generated during the analysis of consumer satisfaction. Each visualization is saved as a separate image file to facilitate easy reference and inclusion in the final report. The contents include:

- **confusion_matrix.png:** A heatmap of the confusion matrix that illustrates the modelâ€™s classification performance.
- **roc_curve.png:** A plot of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve along with the AUC, which evaluates the model's trade-off between true positive and false positive rates.
- **feature_importance.png:** A horizontal bar chart showing the logistic regression coefficients, providing insights into the relative importance of each feature in predicting customer satisfaction.
